        <div class="text"><h2>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show.</h2><br>
                That show's called a pilot. 
                Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. 
                Some pilots get picked and become television programs. 
                Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</div>
        <div class="text"><h2>You think water moves fast?</h2><br> You should see ice. 
            It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. 
            After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. 
            Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. 
            Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. 
            We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. 
            Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

        <div class="text"><h2>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am.</h2><br> 
            I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? 
            He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... 
            You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</div>
        <div class="text"><h2>Heisenberg.</h2><br>You asked me if we were in the meth business or the money business. 
            Neither, Iâ€™m in the empire business. 
            I was under the impression that you had this under control. 
            Well, that's what this is - problem solving. 
            Skyler this is a simple division of labor - I bring in the money, you launder the money. 
            This is what you wanted. </div>
